# cattion
A simple program that turns some texts into a matrix.

e.g.
```
         ### 
        #   #
a   =>  #####
        #   #
        #   #
```
It currently supports letter '`A-Z`' (case insensitive) and the character '`@`'. 

SPACE('` `') triggers a new line. 

Characters without support will be ignored.

## Usage
``` shell
# shell
python3 cattion.py
```

Then input anything you like.
